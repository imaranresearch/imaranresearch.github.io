My current research deals with the modelling of irregular shaped complex granular particles using DEM. I working towards developing a user-package <em> SPHERHARM </em> in LAMMPS.  

#### Modelling of complex-shaped granular particles in LAMMPS using spherical harmonics

Broadly, my research interests lie at the intersection of
programming languages, distributed systems, and formal verification and testing.
More specifically, I am currently pursuing two research directions. First,
I am interested in distributed stream processing, both from the foundational
point of view (what <em>is</em> a distributed stream processing computation?) and the practical point of view (how to implement an efficient stream processing
system?). Second, I am interested in designing effective algorithms for finding
notoriously elusive concurrency bugs in distributed systems.
