<p>Welcome!</p>

<p> I am a Research Scientist boradly interested in computational modelling and simulation of particulate systems and compuational tool development. I currently work as a Process Modeller and Data Scientist at Pfizer. 
Before joining the Pfizer, I was a research associate in the Institute for Infrastructure and Environment at the University of Edinburgh, UK.  My work delt with the mathematical modelling of complex shaped granular particles using Discrete Element Method (DEM). In this project I developed a package <a href="https://github.com/imaranresearch/LAMMPS-SPHERHARM/tree/develop/src/SHDEM">  <em> SHDEM</em> </a> in LAMMPS (open Source C++ based package by Sandia National Laboratory, USA) to model irregular shaped objects. </p>

<p> I completed my joint doctoral dissertation  titled, <a href="https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/Influence_of_particle_smoothness_and_substrate_mechanics_on_the_clustering_of_self-propelled_rods/19217040"> Influence of particle smoothness and substrate mechanics on the clustering of self-propelled rods </a>  from the  Department of  Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the  Monash University and Department of Physics at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.  My key fundamental finding was based on mathematical  modelling of  stochastic systems such as active-matter and  characterization of their spatio-temporal patterns by developing novel algorithms</p>

<p>Before joning UoE, I  obtained a joint PhD degree from Monash University and Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. My <a href="https://monashsoftmatter.wordpress.com/vacancies/">doctoral research work </a> explores the mechanism behind active furrowing in bacterial colonies.</p>
