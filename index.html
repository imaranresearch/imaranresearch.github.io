<p>Welcome!</p>


<p> I am a Computational Scientist, currently working at Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). STFC is part of UK Research and Innovation. I am broadly interested in High perforamnce computing, computational modelling, and compuational tool development. </p> 
<p> Before joining STFC, I worked with  Pfizer as a Process Modeller and Data Scientist. </p>
<p> I had a short stint as a Research Associate in the Institute for Infrastructure and Environment at the University of Edinburgh, UK.  My work delt with the mathematical modelling of complex shaped granular particles using Discrete Element Method (DEM). In this project I developed a package <a href="https://github.com/imaranresearch/LAMMPS-SPHERHARM/tree/develop/src/SHDEM">  <em> SHDEM</em> </a> in LAMMPS (open Source C++ based package by Sandia National Laboratory, USA) to model irregular shaped objects. </p>

<p> I completed my joint doctoral dissertation  titled, <a href="https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/Influence_of_particle_smoothness_and_substrate_mechanics_on_the_clustering_of_self-propelled_rods/19217040"> Influence of particle smoothness and substrate mechanics on the clustering of self-propelled rods </a>  from the  Department of  Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the  Monash University and Department of Physics at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.  My key fundamental finding was based on mathematical  modelling of  stochastic systems such as active-matter and  characterization of their spatio-temporal patterns by developing novel algorithms</p>
